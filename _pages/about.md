**I'm a web developer for [Dave Ramsey](https://www.daveramsey.com) in Nashville, TN.**

My family and I moved here in 2015 from Minnesota, where "soda" is just shorthand for the stuff you mix with vinegar to create a volcano for a junior high science fair. I love what I do, and it's a privilege to do it for a mission that matters.

**I can help you build your next website or digital tool.**

I specialize in building web applications, as well as providing consultation to help you improve or troubleshoot something you already have. Things like this:

- Building a custom, performant website for your small business.
- Constructing an application to solve unique internal challenges.
- Optimizing the front-end performance of your slow website.
- Creating a simple API to consume your data in a particular way.
- Helping you figure out why Google seemingly hates your website.

That list isn't exhaustive. If you need some help, [let's connect](/contact) to get the process started.
